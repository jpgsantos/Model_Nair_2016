#  BioNetGen translation of SBtab [Nair_2016](https://github.com/jpgsantos/Model_Nair_2016) model 
### The model was translated from [SBtab](https://github.com/tlubitz/SBtab) model format to rule-based [BioNetGen language](http://bionetgen.org/) for the simulation with [STEPS](http://steps.sourceforge.net/STEPS/default.php) and [NFsim](http://michaelsneddon.net/nfsim/) solvers embedded in the [subcellular web app](https://subcellular.humanbrainproject.eu/ ) and with the [RuleBender](https://github.com/RuleWorld/rulebender)

### Conversion from SBML to BioNetGen language

The conversion is implemented in ***sbml_to_bngl.py*** python module.
Two approaches are supported by *sbml_to_bngl.transform()* function:
- if *converter='pysb'* - the converter based on the [Atomizer](https://ruleworld.github.io/atomizer/blog/basic/bng.html) implemented in the [PySB](http://pysb.org/) pysb.importers.sbml.sbml_translator() function will be used. The [Atomizer](https://ruleworld.github.io/atomizer/blog/basic/bng.html) will try to modify the set of model molecules and reactions to convert them from reaction network to rule-based BioNetGen format. 
- *if converter='plain'* - a libsbml based converter for sbml level 2, version 4 will be used. This converter produces a bngl approximation to reaction network format of a model. It is assumed that sbml models were obtained by importing a MATLAB simbiology model to sbml, or from SBTAB model by [SBtab to SBML converter](https://github.com/a-kramer/SBtabVFGEN).

Models expressed by SBML and SBTAB often are not fully competible with BNGL.
Additional model adaptation steps are required in this case to obtain a working BNGL model. 
These steps will be partially automatized by *sbml_to_bngl.transform()* function
if *adapt_steps* argument dictionary *'list_of_steps'* is nonempty.

The adaptation steps include:

1) The STEPS and NFsim solvers require different units for species quantities and kinetic rates. An adapted BNGL model provides modifed expressions for all species concentrations and kinetic rates and provides a way for units changing by specification of auxilary bngl model parameters: *Na* and *V_comparment_name*. These parameters should be selected to: *Na=6.022e23* and *V_comparment_name* = volume of corresponding compartment in liters for NFsim and to: *Na=1* and *V_comparment_name=1* for STEPS. 

2) Species with fixed concentrations are not supported by NFsim solver. The BNGL model adaptation will modify model reactions such that a fixed species concentration became a model parameter. This parameter can be used for the clamping of species concentration or for the stimulation pattern application

3) If SBML to BNGL converter implemented in Atomizer is selected then additional transformation steps include renaming of duplicated molecule sites and reparing incorrect molecule names and kinetic rate transformations

4) In case when MATLAB simbiology is used for SBML model creation, adapt_steps will repare incorrect molecule and parameter names

5) Compartmental model of BNGL assumes tree structure of the set of model comartments. This assumption is often incompatible with mesh geometries supported by STEPS. The model adaption steps can produce bngl models with flexible compartmental structure

6) There is a number of incompatibilities between SBTAB and BNGL which still require manual correction. These include concentrations fixed to an expression, functional expressions for reaction rates in case of STEPS solver, some nonstandard types of reaction kinetic functions etc. The adapt_steps detects the cases of known incompatibilities and produces corresponding warning messages
